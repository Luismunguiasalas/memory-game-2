Instructions:

Keep revealing cards while remembering each unveiled card.
Match cards properly with less moves and in faster time.

How I built the Memory Game:
I used HTML,CSS, Javascript and J Query.
I manipulated the DOM, altered parts of the HTML and also styled the game.
Created a deck of cards that shuffles when game is refreshed.
Created a counter to count the number of moves made by player and timer to know the duration of a game.
Added animations to cards when they match and are unmatched.
Create a pop-up modal when player wins the game.
